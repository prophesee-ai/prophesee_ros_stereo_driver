# Prophesee ROS Stereo Driver

![Event-based vision by Prophesee](event-based_vision_PROPHESEE.png)

Note that this repository is experimental (deprecated since Metavision SDK >v2.1.0).

This metapackage contains ROS stereo driver based on a wrapper around [Metavision SDK](https://docs.prophesee.ai/) Driver Module.

It offers the follosing ROS nodes:
  * prophesee_ros_stereo_publisher - publishing data from Prophesee sensors to ROS topics
  * prophesee_ros_stereo_viewer - listening data from ROS topics and visualizing them on a screen

Supported Prophesee EVK:
  * stereo event-based only
  

## Installation

First of all, install Metavision SDK following [these instructions](https://docs.prophesee.ai/getting_started/installation/linux.html).

Then, compile the wrapper code:

  * Clone the source to your catkin workspace ( [create a workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace), if needed)

    ```
        cd catkin_ws/src
        git clone https://github.com/prophesee-ai/prophesee_ros_wrapper.git
        git clone https://github.com/prophesee-ai/prophesee_ros_stereo_driver.git
        cd ..
    ```

  * Compile

    ```
        catkin_make
    ```

  * Source the workspace

    ```
        source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    ```
  
  

## Getting Started
  
### Data publisher

To publish data from Prophesee stereo camera to ROS topics:

  * Update serial numbers of your stereo cameras in prophesee_stereo_publisher.launch file (if not done yet)
    * Find the serial numbers of your cameras
      * either on the camera itself (only the last digits are given, therefore, complete them with zeros up to 8 digits)
      * or via metavision_platform_info tool
    * Update the serial numbers in prophesee_stereo_publisher.launch file using any editor

  * launch the Stereo Publisher

  ```
        roslaunch prophesee_ros_stereo_driver prophesee_stereo_publisher.launch
  ```

The following topics will be published:
  * /prophesee/camera_left/camera_info - info about the left camera
  * /prophesee/camera_left/cd_events_buffer - buffer of CD (Change Detection) events from the left camera
  * /prophesee/camera_right/camera_info - info about the right camera
  * /prophesee/camera_right/cd_events_buffer - buffer of CD (Change Detection) events from the right camera


### Data viewer

To visualize data from ROS topics:

  ```
        roslaunch prophesee_ros_stereo_driver prophesee_stereo_viewer.launch
  ```
